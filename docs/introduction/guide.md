A short guide to help user get started in using the library.

You may also describe the features or design of the library briefly.

If you are using module bundlers such as Webpack, you can directly include package into your project via:

NPM:

``` bash
$ npm install mweui --save

import Vue from 'vue'
import * as mweui from 'mweui'

Vue.use(mweui)
```
